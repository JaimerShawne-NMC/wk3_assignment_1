        <p>
            I don't eat out often, even with my family. On the rare occasions that we do, we would
            usually visit restaurant that we know or frequent. These three restaurants my personal
            favorites out of all the ones I have been to.

        <img src="images/restaurant_garapan.jpg" alt="Garapan Restaurant" width="340" height="auto">
        <p>Garapan Restaurant is a rather nostalgic place for me.
            Because it was located near my huose and I had initially
            taken a liking to it, my family often took me there for splurge occasions.
            I only ever ordered one dish during all my visits there, that being their karaage.
            That still holds true today, and it forever will because they have unfortunately closed
            down, leaving my memories as the only place I can revisit it.</p>

        <h3 id="restaurant2">New Shinsen Sushi Restaurant</h3>
        <img src="images/restaurant_new_shinsen.jpg" alt="New Shinsen Sushi Restaurant" width="340" height="auto">
        <p>New Shinsen Sushi is a sort of evolution from Garapan Restaurant. My dad had worked Shinsen
            for a short period of time, which made it a far more convenient dining option for our splurges.
            This time, I had grown out of my phase of ordering the same item each time, so I took the 
            opportunity to try all of their amazing dishes, from their sushi to their bentos.

        <h3 id="restaurant1">The Sushi Spot</h3>
        <img src="images/restaurant_sushi_spot.jpg" alt="The Sushi Spot" width="340" height="auto">
        <p>The Sushi Spot is a recent endeavor that completely blew all my other experiences
            out the water. I had visited the restaurant with a rather large group, which made
            for a rather rowdy but lively atmosphere. The food itself complimented the experience since
            large platters of different kinds of sushi called for lots of sharing and interaction. This
            made for an incredibly fun and filling dining experience, and I could not have asked for more.
